TODOS:
    - Take a look on TODOs in the application
    - Springboot tutorials
    - Relationship between tables in springboot and Hibernate and JPA
    - Need to take into consideration:
        - sanitize / sanitaze the data,
        - validate the data,
        - limit the data properly,
        - to be a real world application

    - Need to understand to page / pageable
    - Bean and Configuration annotations
    - JPA Hibernate will generate queries based on the properties of the entity, super nice, wow
    - You can investigate more about pagination and the WARN message when doing an operation which requires pagination.
    - N + 1 problem when fetching data
    - Implement swagger for open API support, for client to have informations about requests
    - What is important Docker? Understand Docker
